# HandGestureRecognition
### The model predicts the Hand Gestures.
Implemented a Deep Learning model using Tensorflow that recognizeshand gesturesto facilitate communi-cation between a speech-impaired person and the people who donâ€™t know sign language.

Applied feed-forward Propagation and backward-propagation algorithms to learn the parameters, cross-validationfor assessing the effectiveness of the model and performed feature normalization to speed up the process
